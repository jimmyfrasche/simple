Package simple simplifies direct use of io.Readers.

Generally, you should use *bufio.Reader or the helper functions in io/ioutil
instead of this package.
However, low level io code and library code may mean using an io.Reader directly.

This package provides two helpers.

The first is a struct that wraps an arbitrary io.Reader
and guarantees a stronger contract

The second a function that simplifies calling an arbitrary io.Reader.

They play well together.
